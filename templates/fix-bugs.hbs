Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

I need your help tracking down and fixing some bugs that have been reported in this codebase. Here are the files involved:

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}} 
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`: 

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

I suspect the bugs are related to:
- Incorrect handling of edge cases 
- Off-by-one errors in loops or array indexing
- Unexpected data types
- Uncaught exceptions
- Concurrency issues
- Improper configuration settings

To diagnose:
1. Review the code carefully and systematically 
2. Trace the relevant code paths 
3. Consider boundary conditions and potential error states
4. Look for antipatterns that tend to cause bugs
5. Run the code mentally with example inputs 
6. Think about interactions between components

When you find potential bugs, for each one provide:
1. File path and line number(s)
2. Description of the issue and why it's a bug
3. Example input that would trigger the bug 
4. Suggestions for how to fix it

After analysis, please update the code with your proposed fixes. Try to match the existing code style. Add regression tests if possible to prevent the bugs from recurring.

I appreciate your diligence and attention to detail! Let me know if you need any clarification on the intended behavior of the code.
